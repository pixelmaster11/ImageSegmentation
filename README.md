# ImageSegmentation
 
This project is a simple implementation of OpenCV's watershed algorithm for image segmentation. 

It is an interactive implementation meaning, custom seeds are fed to the watershed algorithm using mouse clicks. 

The below image shows a sample output of feeding custom seeds based on mouse clicks:

The below image represents the generated image segments by the watershed algorithm:
